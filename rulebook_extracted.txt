LANGCHAIN
MYSTERIES
11  February, 2026 thAI based investigation competition where
participants must use Speech-to-Text,
Document Analysis, and LangChain Reasoning
to solve a digital case.

--- Page 2 ---

The competition consists of three stages,
each testing a different AI capability.
Participants have to bring their own laptops
Stage 1 → Audio Intelligence
Stage 2 → Document Forensics
Stage 3 → Final Reasoning
Each Stage contains 5–6 auto-graded
questions.
No stage can be solved without running the
required pipeline.

Stage 1 – Audio Intelligence
Participants receive four audio files.
Using Speech-to-Text + LangChain,
teams must extract answers to questions.
Answers are submitted through the
portal.
Stage 2 – Document Forensics
Participants receive a multi-page
dossier.
Using LangChain with an LLM, teams must
extract:
Who accessed system logs and finances
Who conducted unauthorized
experiments
No embeddings or vector databases are
allowed.
Stage 3 – Final Case Resolution
Participants receive additional
documents and using a LangChain
reasoning chain, teams must determine
the murderer.
