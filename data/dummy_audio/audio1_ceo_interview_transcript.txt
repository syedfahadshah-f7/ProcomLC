        CEO Interview - Marcus Thorne (CASE B)

        I arrived at the Robotics Lab at 7 AM to check on the 'Apex' prototype before the investor demo.
        I found the prototype completely destroyed. The main CPU was smashed, and the servo motors were
        ripped out.
        
        Only three people had access codes to the lab last night: Lead Engineer Elena Rostova, 
        Intern Kevin Miller, and our competitor's former employee who we just hired, Victor Krum.
        
        I know Elena was furious about the project timeline. She said it was 'impossible' to finish.
        But destroying her own work? I don't know.
