        Janitor Witness - Old Man Jenkins (CASE B)

        I was mopping the hallway outside the secure lab. Around 9:30 PM, I saw someone enter the lab.
        They used a keycard. I couldn't see their face clearly, but they were wearing a red hoodie.
        
        I know for a fact that Victor Krum owns a red hoodie. I've seen him wear it to work.
        About 15 minutes later, I heard loud crashing noises. Bang! Smash! I thought maybe the robot fell over.
        The person ran out a minute later.
