        Intern Statement - Kevin Miller (CASE B)

        I left the lab at 8 PM. Everything was fine. The Apex robot was standing in the center of the room.
        I did see Victor Krum lingering around the server room door. He looked... suspicious. He was 
        on his phone, speaking in a hushed tone. I heard him say 'It will be done tonight'.
        
        Elena left before me, around 7:30 PM. She seemed stressed but not angry. She actually high-fived
        me on her way out, saying the calibration was finally perfect.
